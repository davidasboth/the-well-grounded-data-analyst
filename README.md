# The Well-Grounded Data Analyst

![Asboth-MEAP](https://github.com/davidasboth/solve-any-data-analysis-problem/assets/10253275/5f13aadb-eb84-4b0a-8c37-3cf79218175e)

Hello!

This repository contains the accompanying data and example solution code for The Well-Grounded Data Analyst (Manning, 2025).

You can buy the book here: [https://www.manning.com/books/the-well-grounded-data-analyst](https://www.manning.com/books/the-well-grounded-data-analyst)

In each chapter folder, you will find the data files required to attempt the project along with Jupyter notebooks containing the example solution code, which I walk through in great detail in the book.

Currently, the one exception is chapter 4 where the data files are too large for GitHub and can be found elsewhere. See the README in the chapter-4 folder for details.

In the future, different versions of the libraries may produce different results, so I have included the files required to recreate the virtual environment I used for the solutions. The use of these is detailed in an appendix in the book.

As I say in the book, I recommend attempting the projects yourself before looking at the example solutions.

Have fun!

David
